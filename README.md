# Microarchitectural Vulnerability Detection
This project investigates how best to utilize traces from pre-silicon simulation for vulnerability detection at the microarchitectural level of abstraction during the IC design life-cycle.  In particular, the analysis is focused on traces from executions of security critical applications in order to validate claims of properties enabling confidentiality protections.

The RISC-V BOOM processor released with the Chipyard framework from UC Berkeley is used as a testbed, along with cryptographic primitives from the BearSSL library as applications to study.

## Software Modules

The minimally modified version of the RISC-V BOOM core must be
